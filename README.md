# 21_Card_Trick

Welcome to the 21 card trick game!
You will be the expectator and the application will be the magitian! 
The magician will take 21 cards from the deck and place them on the table, one by one, forming three columns with seven cards each.

Now, the magician will ask you to mentally choose one of the cards on the table, without saying which one it is. It is important to remember not to reveal your choice out loud.

Once you've chosen a card, the magician will take the three columns of cards and build a new deck with the card you chose under the other two columns. For example, if your chosen card is in the middle column, the magician will place that column between the other two.

Then the magician will repeat the deck building process a few times, shuffling the cards in a mysterious and skillful way. This is done to ensure that your letter's location is completely unknown.

After the mixes, the magician will reveal the deck and, with a discerning eye, will be able to identify your card!
